[![checks][github]][action] ![style][codestyle] ![phpstan][phpstan] [![coverage][coverage]][codecov]

W is a lightweight CMS tool, meant to help you design a website using a unique approach. It's targeting artists, or experimental projects.

To have a better idea of what W can do, you can check out the [User manual](MANUAL.md), or dicover the [ideas](#ideas) behind this specific tool.

If tou want to try it out, you can :

- follow the [install instructions](#how-to-install) to host your own instance of W.
- be hosted for free by [club1.fr](https://club1.fr) as an official tester (please contact [vincent@club1.fr](mailto:v.peugnet@free.fr) for more info).
- [install from sources](#install-from-sources), if you want to contribute to the code.

W is a free and open source tool under [the AGPLv3 License](LICENSE). The project was initiated in 2018 by Vincent Peugnet.

Ideas
-----

**W** was first a tool, based on my way of thinking, as a protesis, to write on ideas and create a self explorating text point n' click game.

It's a mix between a drive, a wiki and a personnal blog. You can create page very quickly and share them with other people or keep them for you and restricted people.  
There is no boundaries beetween taking notes and creating a website. When you create a page, you create a space in internet, a place, that can be public or private. Then, you decide to link it or not with the others places you've created before.
There is a lots of possibilites of creations, for people who need to create multi-aspect labyrinth websites, to use a half public/private mindmap, or even interactives fictions.

Highlights
----------

W try to help you create pages more spontaneously.

- Very lightweight page loading and editor
- Use standards to edit your pages : markdown, HTML, CSS and Javascript
- [Media manager](MANUAL.md#media-manager)
- Multi-users
- Geolocalisation : generate map using page's coordinates **(BETA)**
- Flat file database
- Great website architecture design freedom
- [url based command interface](MANUAL.md#url-based-command-interface)
- 100% functionnal even without javascript

Screenshots

An API exist but is experimental for now (v0). Find more info [in the API documentation](API.md)

Development team
----------------

W is a project created and maintained by [Vincent Peugnet](https://github.com/vincent-peugnet), an amateur computer science enthousiast who can only code in PHP. It now includes [Nicolas Peugnet](https://github.com/n-peugnet) (his brother) as JS developer, technical advisor and every challenges that are too complicated for Vincent.
We can also mention [Guilhem PrÃ©vost Leygonie]() as legendary number one user and now as an issue writer too.


- [James Moss's Flywheel Database](https://github.com/jamesmoss/flywheel)
- [Michel Fortin's Markdown Extra](https://github.com/michelf/php-markdown)
- [Plates](https://github.com/thephpleague/plates) as template engine.
- [Nicolas Peugnet](https://nicolas.club1.fr/) for the technical support





How to install
==============

__Server requirements__

- apache server
- PHP >=7.4.0 and the following extensions: `curl mbstring xml`

__W__ don't need any database manager as it use a "flat file" system.


Install the latest release
--------------------------

Simply download the [latest realease](https://github.com/vincent-peugnet/wcms/releases/latest) from github, and unzip it in your hosted folder. You can put W at the root of your domain, or in subfolders. Then access the adress in your browser and follow the differents steps.

W will ask you for the path you've installed it, if you installed it at the root, leave this field blank, otherwise, indiquate the subfolders like `path/to/wcms`.


Install using git
-----------------

If you have a SSH access to your server, you can install W from sources by following thoses [three steps](#install-from-sources).

To update, type `git pull` to update Git files from repo, then type `make` to build the JS files.

Development informations
========================

If you want to contribute to the project.

Prerequisites
-------------

- PHP >=7.4.0
- PHP extensions : curl mbstring xml
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
- _Optionally_ [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)

### Debian and derivatives

    sudo apt install php php-curl php-mbstring php-xml composer nodejs npm

Install from sources
--------------------

1.  Clone the git repository.
2.  Install PHP dependencies.

        make vendor

3.  _Optionally_ install and build JS dependencies to get UI enhancements.

        make build

The last two commands can be run at once using only `make`.

There are 3 different build environments that `make` can use:

-   **`dev`** _when developing the application._  
    It installs every dependencies and builds big but easy-to-debug js bundles.

-   **`prod`** _when installing from sources a deployed production application._  
    It installs every dependencies and builds minified js bundles.

-   **`dist`** _to create the releases' distribution zip._  
    It strips all the development dependencies and the error reporting module and the sourcemaps of the js bundles are hidden. It can also be used for a production environment if the error reports are not used.

The build environment can be set either for each `make` command by changing it in the `.env` file or on a per command basis by adding it at the end of the command (e.g. `make build ENV=prod`).

PHP development
---------------

You can easily run a dev server using the `serve` target:

    make serve

There is an error reporting debug mode using [Whoops](https://github.com/filp/whoops). It can be enabled by setting the value of `debug` in `config.json` to one of [editors supported by Whoops](https://github.com/filp/whoops/blob/master/docs/Open%20Files%20In%20An%20Editor.md).

JS development
--------------

While developing JS code it is useful to run webpack in watch mode so that the bundles get built at each file change. To do so, use the following command:

    make watch

To run both the php dev server and webpack in watch mode, it is possible to run:

    make dev

Run checks
---------

Multiple tools are used to perform checks on the source code:

-   **phpcs** to lint PHP code

        make lint

-   **phpunit** to run unit test on PHP code
 
        make test

All checks can be run with a single command

    make check [--keep-going]

Publish a new release
---------------------

The release process uses GitHub's CLI so you will need to have it installed (`sudo apt install gh`).
It also uploads sourcemaps to [Sentry](https://sentry.io/).
So to create and publish a new release you will need two access tokens:
-   a [GitHub personnal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) with `repository` access
-   a [Sentry authentification token](https://sentry.io/settings/account/api/auth-tokens/) with `project:read`, `project:releases` and `org:read` access

saved in a `.env` file like so:

```bash
# .env
GITHUB_TOKEN='<github token value>'
SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN='<sentry token value>'
```

Then, to make the release, run one of the following command:

    make release-patch
    make release-minor
    make release-major

To only build the release zip, simply run `make dist`. This will create a zip file in `dist/` of the current version.
